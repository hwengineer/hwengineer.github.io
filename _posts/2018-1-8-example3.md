title: ld.lld and linker files
---

LLVM's linker was a real pain. But I know now how to use it.

# LLVM linker (ld.lld-5.0)

To get my STM32 to run I have to tell the linker where to store the executable data.

This is usually done with a linker file. But unfortunately `ld.lld` doesn't support the same gcc-linker format.

## mem.ld
