We now look at the first example project [STM32F3Discovery-meson-example](https://github.com/hwengineer/STM32F3Discovery-meson-example).
It's for the [STM32F3Discovery](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html) Development Board from ST Semiconductor

### linker, startup files

In the folders STM32-ldscripts and STM32-startup are microcontroller dependend
configuration files saved.
For a running application we need to specify the right linker and startup scripts.
I will discuss that topic later.

### STM32 HAL Driver

In this folder we find the STM32 HAL / CMSIS Drivers from ST.
Sadly ST doesn't host a github repo at the moment. So I had to copy the files to github.
The files are under the license from ST.

### meson files
To configure meson we need two files.

Normally the `meson.build` file is sufficient. But when we do a cross-compilation build
we need also a `cross-file` for defining the right compilers and special target flags.

### usage

1.  cloning repo and change to project folder

>git clone https://github.com/hwengineer/STM32F3Discovery-meson-example

>cd STM32F3Discovery-meson-example

2.  create a build directory

>mkdir llvmbuild

3.  init the build system

>meson llvmbuild --cross-file=cross_file

4.  change to build directory

>ch llvmbuild

5.  start compilation process

>ninja

### flash uC

1.  start openocd (for the STM32F3Discovery use this parameters)

>openocd -f interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f target/stm32f3x.cfg

2.  start a gdb session

>arm-none-eabi-gdb -q main.elf

3.  configure and load the uC with gdb

>(gdb)target remote:3333 # connect to openocd gdb server (standard port 3333)

>(gdb)load               # load binary

>(gdb)continue           # start execution
